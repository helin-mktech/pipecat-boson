## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- Aligned the default Higgs Realtime and STT model identifiers with the public API.
- Renamed the public `modalities` option to the OpenAI-compatible `output_modalities`.
- Removed the unsupported transcription prompt setting from the public API.

### Fixed

- Send Pipecat tool results to Boson without JSON-encoding the already-serialized output a second time.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Added `BosonRealtimeLLMService` for using the Boson Realtime API from Pipecat pipelines.
